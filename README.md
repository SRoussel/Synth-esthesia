# Synth-esthesia
*A casual music and visual art creator by Sam Roussel.*


### Overview
This project is an exploration of the intersection between music and visual art, where users both compose music and draw an image. The user can select the color to draw with and the note or chord to play (these are paired, red goes to C4, orange goes to D4, etc.). There is UI to change the volume/stroke width (which correlate) start and stop recordings, play them back, save them, toggle between playing notes and chords, toggle erasing mode, and save the image. By considering both audio and visuals at the same time, the user is drawn deeper into the creative experience. They are also easily able to share their finished product. 

### Tech
This project uses uses p5js, including the sound library, which comes included in the standard [download](https://p5js.org/download/). To run, simply point a web server at the folder.

### Significance
Music has always been an important part of my life. Even in more typical contexts, music is often represented visually; sheet music comes to mind. I have greatly enjoyed using [HookTheory](https://www.hooktheory.com), an online composition tool which uses color coding of notes and chords. While I do not have synesthesia, the relationships between the notes and the colors is compelling to me. I hope this system can help bring together music and visual arts in new and exciting ways for its users.

### Challenge
I have never used javascript, processing, or really done any web development before, so I learned quite a lot. The biggest challenge was probably the beginning of the project, where the possibilities felt endless. I considered doing something with fractals, cellular automata, and music. Even after I settled on something music related, I wasn't sure exactly how it would intersect with the canvas in processing. The best way to get past this analysis phase was just to jump into processing and see what sorts of features there were. Moving forward, I think this kind of exploration is the most exciting and the most effective. With a long winter break coming up, I hope to take similar dives into other areas of interest.
